This is my first Blog post. I am just starting to learn how to use Git Pages to create content for this blog.

I am confined to my Office for now, but I am very anxious to get back on the road. Here is my Top Ten List of places that I want to go when I get out of this house:

1. Walt Disney World...of course, it would be for Kathryn's birthday! 
2. Virginia Beach (to get this cool Acura RDX)
3. Denver...to go skiing
4. London
5. Paris 
6. Germany
7. Italy
8. Israel
9. Grand Canyon
10. Yosemite National Park
