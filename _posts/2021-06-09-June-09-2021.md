Today I talked to Kenosha about how we might be able to enroll Kaden into Germantown High School. The main way that we are thinking about getting him into the program is by way of the CAPA Program,
which includes various activities related to performing arts. We will lok to get him into the Film and Video cohort, but we will need to deelop a portfolio of photos 
or video content to use as a resume to determine if he has the interest to participate in the program.
