Today I talked to my awesome, vibrant, beautiful wife about how we might be able to enroll Kaden into Germantown High School. The main way that we are thinking about getting him into the school is via the CAPA Program, which includes various activities related to performing arts. Specifically, we are trying to get him into the Film and Video cohort, but we will need to develop a portfolio of photos or video content to use as a resume to determine if he has the interest to participate in the program.

Kaden will need need to prepare this content on his own, but I will be working with him to try to compile all of the requirements noted by the school administrator.

It has been a fun summer thus far. Kaden and I just returned from Madison, Wisconsin to visit my workplace. I think he enjoyed himself, especially a visit to an area just north of the city called the Dells. I also brought him along with me to visit some of my co-workers. 

Here is a photo of him stiting next to Lake Monona in Madison:
