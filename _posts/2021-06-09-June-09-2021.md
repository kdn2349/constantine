Today I talked to Kenosha about how we might be able to enroll Kaden into Germantown High School. The main way that we are thinking about getting him into the program is by way of the CAPA Program,
which includes various activities related to performing arts. We will lok to get him into the Film and Video cohort, but we will need to deelop a portfolio of photos 
or video content to use as a resume to determine if he has the interest to participate in the program.



Kaden will need need to prepare this content on his own, so I will be working with him to try to compile all of the requirements noted by the school administrator.


It has been a fun summer thus far, and Kaden and I just returned from Madison, Wisconsin to visit my workplace. I think he enjoyred himself, especaillay a vist to an area just north of the city called the Dells. I also brought him along to visit some of my co-workers. 

Here is a photo of him stiting next to a lake in Madison:
